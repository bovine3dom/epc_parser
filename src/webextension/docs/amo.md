# Summary

Helps you to find digs that are green. Inlines EPC (energy performance certificate) images on listing pages for properties on Zoopla and rightmove.

# Description

Most housing in the UK is poorly insulated, draughty and expensive to heat. This extension makes it easier to find the few properties that are energy efficient by prominently showing their energy performance certificates (EPCs) on the search results pages on Zoopla and rightmove.

Only about 1 in 3 properties disclose their EPC in a way that this extension can read. With luck, this will improve with time.
